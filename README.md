# Serpico Host Tracker
This is a plugin for Serpico that allows you to manage and track hosts found during a pentest.

## WARNING!
Use at your own risk! I am not a developer or a programmer. I am just someone who likes to poke at things and sometimes play with code.  

## License
Use it; abuse it; do whatever you want with it.

## Expectations
Simple, do not have any. I am not going to regularly update this thing. I am just working on it because I have a wild hair up my butt to have this functionallity in Scerpico.

## Installation
This will tell you all you need... maybe: https://github.com/SerpicoProject/Serpico/wiki/Plug-ins

Incase that did not give you enough info, here is how I would do it if I were you, assuming you are in the Scerpico root.
`git clone man715/host_tracker.git plugins`
Serpico should take care of the rest.

## Database
This plugin uses the master.db that is set up when you setup Serpico. If you do not like that, you will have to make some major changes to this plugin.
I did this because I did not want to manage more than one database. (Yeah, I know it is a single file. What can I say, I'm lazy.)

## Attribution
Look let's be honest, I'm not a programmer so this code pretty much is ripped from other parts of Serpico. Only the crappy parts are really mine. So thanks to you peeps at Serpico.
