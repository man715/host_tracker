# Serpico Host Tracker
This is a plugin for Serpico that allows you to manage and track hosts found during a pentest. 

## WARNING!
Use at your own risk! I am not a developer or a programmer. I am just someone who likes to poke at things and sometimes play with code.  

## License
Use it; abuse; do whatever you want with it.

## Expectations
Simple, do not have any. I am not going to regularly update this thing. I am just working on it because I have a wild hair up my butt to have this functionallity in Scerpico.

## Installation
This will tell you all you need maybe: https://github.com/SerpicoProject/Serpico/wiki/Plug-ins

Incase that did not give you enough info, here is how I would do it if I were you, assuming you are in the Scerpico root.
`git clone man715/host_tracker.git plugins`
Serpico should take care of the rest.
